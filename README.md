Udundi Coding Challenge

**CODING CHALLENGE REQUIREMENTS**   

~ Use Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com) Framework
~ HTML5, JS, & CSS3 (for a bonus use SCSS)
~ Please include some sort of animation for the page, this is a chance to use some creativity. Here is a Javascript library to provide some animation guidance if needed (not required): AOS Animation JS https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/
~ Animate “Explore” on initial page load
~ Animate the text box when the “More Details” button is clicked

*Explanation*

Upon loading the page, you are greeted with the word 'Explore' being animated through a color gradient of orange and yellow back to white. Upon clicking the plus icon, the elements scroll away and are replaced with a box of conent that fades on screen, expanding open to revealing the content scrolling on to the screen.

*Technologies Used*

HTML, CSS, jQuery

I utilized some basic layout elements of Bootstrap, traditional HTML with some inline styling on a few elements, CSS for some custom styling of components and as the engine for the gradient animation, and then finally jQuery, which handled the animation, population of content, and timing for the smooth feel

I decided to go the route of plain HTML, CSS, and jQuery for a simple and clean animation design. There are a plethora of libraries and frameworks to use that speed up the development time and have 'out-of-the-box' animations to use and make it look pretty, but I preferred to show my competency with the basic building blocks.
